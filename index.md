# The beginning!

A small website for posting small coding projects, related to my work on ancient DNA

## Progress
A tiny project self-explanatorily called [Diamond Output Parser](https://github.com/jannine-forst/diamond_output_parser):
- takes diamond.krona html output and pulls out interesting things
- makes a multipage pdf of all the counts/root
- work in progress!!

E.g. [here](https://github.com/jannine-forst/diamond_output_parser/blob/master/Trial_DMND/DMNDparsed.graphs.outfile.2018.11.15_11-10.pdf)
